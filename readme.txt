# Exploring US Bike Share Data:

In this project, I used Python to explore data related to the bike share systems of three major cities â€” Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC. I wrote code to import the data and compute descriptive statistics. I also wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal.

# Datasets:
Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
User Type (Subscriber or Customer)
The Chicago and New York City files also provide the following two columns:
Gender
Birth Year

new_york_city.csv
